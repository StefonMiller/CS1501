This program reads in a graph representation of a network, creates the appropriate edges, nodes, etc. and allows for modification of said nodes. In terms of functionality, users are able to display the current active network, display a minimum spanning tree, display the shortest path from one node to another, display each distinct path from one vertex to another, bring nodes up/down in the network, and change the weight of an edge.
